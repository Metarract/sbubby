## TODOS?

- Shadows
  - Global shadow applied over everythin
  - sbubby's light cuts through that completely
  - light still occluded by the occluders
  - terrain only affected by global shadow
    - probably?

## Considerations

- PAUSE MODE?????
  - SceneTree.paused -> boolean

- Typescript in Godot?
    - https://github.com/GodotExplorer/ECMAScript
- Particles2d -> replace my dumb script?
  - ParticleMaterial
- Remote debuggin'?
  - Debug menu -> Deploy with remote debug (look this shit up)
- NavigationPath2D
  - maybe useful for male anglerfishes helping out momma anglerfish

## Ideas


- enemies
  - AmbienFish
  - AngerFish -> like an anglerfish but. angier.
  - Shocky Fish

- npcs
  - anglerfish momma
  - blind cave fish + lost cave fish child

- fishing
  - speed boost via fish (see dolphins, MC)
  - friendly fighters
  - pure cosmetic familiars (rare)
  - suicide bomb fish?
  - fish up scrap metals/garbage (rarely), repairs sub
  - money(?)
  - pupfish

- shop
  - giant anglerfish shopkeep
  - she has small male anglerfish help her
  - shark? (what do we do with anglerfish lady NPC and her minions)
    - multiple vendors?
    - sharks vs jets

- limited use secondary fires (ala isaac bombs)
  - open up other paths
  - sekrit areas

- Different starting parameters?
  - map generation
    - differing paths

- maybe a high current dead-end zone with a secret in it
  - can't get past the current normally
  - bring strong fish with you to have them help you through
  - maybe pupfish pulls you?
    - put a leash on the pupfish and they go wild and pull you through
